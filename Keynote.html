    <strong> Abstract: </strong>
   Digital Twin (DT) has been widely envisioned as a major intelligent application of 6G wireless networks in creating highly real-time and reliable wireless-connected environments to support efficient interactions and interplays between physical and virtual objects. On the other hand, DT has been widely recognized as a promising 6G wireless technique to efficiently realize the practical implementation of metaverse featured by various powerful virtual realities. As a digital representation of an intended real-world physical object, a DT needs to be timely and reliably updated by and synchronized with the corresponding physical systems. As a result, the stringent quality-of-service (QoS) guaranteed mobile wireless networks play the crucial role in efficiently supporting DT's systems  designing and performance modeling and analyses. Correspondingly, a large number of 6G wireless techniques have been identified and developed to enable the QoS-provisioning for implementing and supporting DT's. However, how to efficiently integrate the various advanced 6G wireless techniques for supporting DT's QoS guarantees over 6G mobile networks has imposed many new open-problems/issues not encountered before. To conquer these challenges, a great deal of efforts have been made in developing various 6G key promising-candidate techniques in terms of principle, theory, architecture, protocol, technologies, etc. Towards the above ends, in this tutorial I will address a number of QoS-Driven 6G Wireless Techniques for efficiently supporting DT mobile networks, which include: (1) Statistical-QoS theory; (2) massive Ulrta-Low Latency Communications (mURLLC); (3) Metaverse, VR, and XR; (4) Integrated Sensing, and Communications (ISAC); (5) Multi-Tier Computing; (6) Finite Blocklength Coding (FBC); (7) Wireless Caching; (8) massive-MIMO; (9) network functions virtualization (NFV); (10) information-centric network (ICN); (11) software defined networks (SDN); (12) Full Duplex (FD); (13) Device-to-Device (D2D), (14) mmWAVE; (15) THz + NANO Networks, (16) AI + ML, etc. and how these techniques can be integrated to efficiently support the statistical delay and error-rate bounded QoS provisioning for supporting/implementing DT over 6G mobile wireless networks. Furthermore, we will also discuss several future research directions, obstacles, and open problems in the general areas for 6G mobile wireless networks.

    <strong> Title: 6G Digital Twin Networks </strong></h3>

  <p align="justify" style="margin-left:80px; margin-right:80px;  font-size: 20px">
    <strong> Abstract: </strong> The future generation of wireless communications requires the stringent quality-of-service (QoS) requirements in terms of very high data rate, ultra-high success reception rate, and minimal latency. Supported by high QoS wireless communications, digital twin has become a game-changing technology in many applications including smart city, manufacturing, automotive, gaming, entertaining, and climate resilience. Edge computing-based wireless ultra-reliable and low-latency communications (URLLC) in 6G has been considered as a key technique to realise the full potential of digital twin. This talk discusses a joint communications and computation design of URLLC multi-tier computing in 6G that supports digital twin networks, not only fundamental requirements, but also enabling technologies, visions, and future challenges.
